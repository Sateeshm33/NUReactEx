Project overview:
1. The project is a simple dashboard with a list. The list can be filtered using time duration like (All, Today, This Week, This Month, This Year). And can be searched using the name of the project.
2. See this design for the project overview https://invis.io/BFJP707T7C6. There are multiple views that you can switch between to see how it breaks down on mobile
3. Clicking on each list item will take user to the new screen with more description about the item (please check the design for mobile compatibility)
4. Mock data is attached in this repo.

Instructions for the project development:
1. Extensive use of React
2. Redux implementation
3. Mock data should be served from a mock server.
4. Do not use any boilerplate like react-create-app. Better write your own webpack configuration.
5. CSS/SASS
6. ES6
7. Better to have unit tests and linting.
